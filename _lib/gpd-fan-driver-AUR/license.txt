Obtained from above links either without explicit license or under the inherited presumably 'GPLv2' license. Statements on relevant websites regarding 'GPL-2.0-or-later' license, may or may not be valid - this is unknown. Licensing under a later version may not make sense considering the Linux Kernel 'GPLv2' license.
